# Frontend Mentor - Contact Form Solution

This is my solution to the **Contact Form** challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project focuses on building an accessible, responsive contact form with real-time validation, clean UI feedback, and a user-friendly experience using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The challenge was a great opportunity to practice semantic HTML, modern CSS techniques, and custom form validation logic without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## Overview
This project is a responsive contact form designed to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It provides clear validation feedback, interactive states, and a success message upon successful submission.

The form includes text inputs, email validation, radio buttons, a textarea, and a consent checkbox. All validation is handled with custom JavaScript logic, ensuring full control over the user experience and error handling.

---

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.
- Experience a mobile-first responsive design.
- Fill out and submit the contact form with required fields.
- Receive real-time validation feedback while typing.
- See clear error messages for invalid or missing inputs.
- Select a query type using radio buttons.
- Submit the form only when all fields are valid.
- See a success message after a successful submission.
- Experience hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

## My process
- Structured the form using **semantic HTML5** elements such as `form`, `section`, `label`, `input`, and `textarea`.
- Followed a **mobile-first approach**, enhancing the layout with media queries for larger screens.
- Built layouts using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** where appropriate.
- Used **CSS custom properties (variables)** to manage colors and maintain a consistent design system.
- Applied the **BEM naming convention** to keep the CSS modular, readable, and scalable.
- Styled form elements with hover, focus, and active states to improve usability and accessibility.
- Implemented **custom form validation** using vanilla JavaScript.
- Used **regular expressions** to validate email input.
- Displayed validation errors dynamically by toggling CSS classes.
- Added **real-time validation feedback** using input events.
- Controlled UI states such as error messages and success messages through JavaScript.
